# Code for programmable logic devices used in the system

This directory contains the GALasm code for the PLDs used in the rosco_m68k. 

At the moment, this is just the address decoder (1 PLD replaces six 7400-series ICs), 
and the IO glue logic for the MC68901 (1 PLD replaces four 7400-series ICs).
