# Firmware & Software

This directory contains the currently-supported release of the 
rosco_m68k firmware.

Depending on where we are in the development cycle, the development
firmware may also be present here (with a name like `rosco_m68k_development`).

Old firmware versions and other legacy, unsupported code can be 
found under the `attic` directory. This code is retained for 
historical interest only, and is not guaranteed to work (or even build!).
